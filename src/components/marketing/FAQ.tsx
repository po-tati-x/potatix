    question: "What exactly does Potatix do?",
    answer: "Potatix is a minimalist platform built specifically for software developers who want to sell technical courses. We handle payment processing, video hosting, and basic user auth - that's it. No bloat, no BS, just the core features you actually need."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "Just 10% of your revenue. Zero monthly fees, no setup costs, no hidden charges. You only pay when you actually make money. Standard payment processing fees (Stripe's 2.9% + 30Â¢) apply separately."
  },
  {
    question: "Why did you build this?",
    answer: "Most platforms are bloated with features nobody uses, charge monthly fees even when you're not selling, and weren't built for developers. We created the minimal solution we wish existed - focused exclusively on dev course creators who want a simple way to sell their technical content."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to set up?",
    answer: "Under 10 minutes. Upload your videos, set a price, get a payment link. That's it. No need to waste days configuring complex settings or figuring out unnecessary features."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have an existing course somewhere else?",
    answer: "Just upload your videos and start selling. No complicated migration process because there's not much to migrate. We're designed for simplicity - but if you need help moving over, just ask."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your tech stack?",
    answer: "Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, and Vercel. We're built by developers, for developers, using modern tech that we trust."
  },
  {
    question: "What about marketing, community features, gamification, AI, etc.?",
    answer: "We don't have any of that stuff. Potatix focuses exclusively on the core problem: letting you sell access to your videos. For everything else, there are better specialized tools you can use. We believe in doing one thing well rather than many things poorly."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to leave Potatix?",
    answer: "Export your content and student data anytime. No lock-in, no hostage-taking. We don't believe in trapping users - if we're not providing value, you should be able to leave easily."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this NOT for?",
    answer: "If you need fancy marketing tools, community features, or complex course structures with quizzes and certificates, Potatix isn't for you. We're for developers who want a simple, no-BS way to sell their technical knowledge without the overhead."
